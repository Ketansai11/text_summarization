1.Introduction
This project aims to summarize news articles using various text summarization techniques, including graph-based methods and BERT embeddings. The goal is to produce concise and coherent summaries from longer texts.

2.Setup and Installation
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7+
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Cufflinks
NLTK
Scikit-learn
Transformers
You can install the required packages using pip.

3.Data Loading
The notebook begins by setting up the environment and loading the data. It includes paths for news articles and their summaries. Ensure you have the dataset in the specified directory structure.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis
Before diving into the modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data distribution and characteristics. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for this purpose.

5.Model Implementation
The notebook implements several models for text summarization, including:

Graph-based summarization: Using algorithms like TextRank.
BERT embeddings: Leveraging pre-trained BERT models for generating summaries.
6.Results
Results from the models are evaluated using metrics such as BLEU score to ensure the quality and coherence of the summaries.

7.Conclusion
The project showcases various techniques for text summarization and provides insights into their performance. Future work may involve exploring other advanced models and fine-tuning strategies.
